# Online_Quiz

## Objectives

In this activity I was asked to create an online quiz game that asked the user a series of questions that would display one at a time. The quiz was supposed to be timed and if all questions were not answered in time result in a game over that would log the users score. In this activity I made use of JavaScript objects and arrays to create a series of questions while modifying the DOM elements of the HTML to create a dynamic page.
